# Branches

You can create a branch from the 'master' which is a copy of the 'master' set of code you've made, this allows you to make changes and fixes. Allowing you to make these changes to your code while also reserving the current code in the 'master' branch. This allows for you to create another branch from the 'master' make the changes and if it doesn't work you can just abandon that branch. Or in the case of it working  you can Merge the changes you made back into the 'master' allowing for it to join into the 'master' branch.
